                PITTSBURGH — As the first funerals for victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue attack began on Tuesday morning, President Trump
                prepared to visit the grief-stricken city to pay respects. Even before he landed though, some local officials
                implored him to stay away while the community began burying its dead. In the aftermath of one of the deadliest
                anti-Semitic attacks in American history, the president will make a brief trip Tuesday afternoon with his
                wife, Melania Trump, as well as his daughter Ivanka Trump, who is Jewish, and her husband Jared Kushner,
                the grandson of Holocaust survivors. The top four Republican and Democratic congressional leaders who were
                invited to join him all declined, according to officials familiar with the planning who spoke on condition
                of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment. Mr. Trump’s stop is an opportunity for him to play
                the traditional role of consoler in chief that presidents often step into after a national tragedy. But in
                the wake of the shooting and a recent spate of mailed explosive devices, Mr. Trump has been reluctant to
                blunt his bitter political attacks, arguing that his supporters crave his incendiary rhetoric. Campbell Robertson
                reported from Pittsburgh and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington. Ken Belson contributed reporting from
                New York.
